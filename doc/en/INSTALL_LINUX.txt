REQUIREMENTS

These library are required to success at the compilation of the wmavo
plugin for Avogadro. If you have Synaptic (or equivalent), you just need 
to open it and "search and install package":

  - gcc 4.4.4 or later
  - g++ 4.4.4 or later
  - cmake (2.8 at least)
  - zlib (1.2.3 at least)
      AND zlib1g-dev (1.2.3 at least)
  - python with :
      python2.6-dev
      AND libboost-python1.42-dev (1.40 at least)
      (some abstract class of Avogadro ask them to generate plugins)
  - Avogadro 1.0.1 or later (1.0.0 at least)
      AND libavogadro-dev 1.0.1 (1.0.0 at least)
      (it will install Qt4, OpenBabel, Eigen 2.0.3 ...)
  - BlueZ 4.69 (4.60 at least)
      AND libbluetooth-dev 4.69 (4.60 at least)

Then, in a terminal, go in the wmavo root directory :
  cd [...]/wmavo/
  

BASIC INSTALL MODE :

In this mode, you need to install other libraries before. If you 
have Synaptic (or equivalent), search :

  - freeglut3 2.6
      AND freeglut3-dev 2.6
  - libglew1.5 1.52
      AND libglew1.5-dev 1.52

Then launch the script compile_install.sh in the script directory.
  cd ./script/
  bash compile_install.sh

  CAUTION :
    If you use Avogadro with the 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 version, be careful where the 
    plugins are copied : 
      - in /usr/lib/avogadro/1_0/[engines,extensions,tools] .
    Else, they will be :
      - in /usr/local/lib/avogadro/1_0/[engines,extensions,tools] .
    Verify the version of Avogadro with the command : 
      avogadro --version


ADVANCED INSTALL MODE :

  INSTALLATION (part1/2)

To use the Wiimote, it is necessary to have a library dedicated to
the Wiimote. The used library is, in fact are, wiiuse and wiiusecpp.
The wiiuse library is the heart (can manage the Wiimote under *nix and 
Windows environment). The wiiusecpp library add the cpp support.

This library are present in the extra directory. This version (0.12.2) 
is improved compared with the version (0.12) get on Internet.

To compile them :

  - wiiuse
      cd ./extra/wiiuse
      make wiiuse
      sudo make install
      cd ../../

  - wiiusecpp
      cd ./extra/wiiusecpp
      (sudo) make wiiusecpp
      sudo make install
      cd ../../


  INSTALLATION (part2/2)

There are 3 plugins for Avogadro :
  - wmengine : to get the anaglyph (red/cyan) render with ball and stick 
      visualisation ;
  - wmextension and wmtool : to include the Wiimote in Avogadro.

For the Wiimote (the wmextension and wmtool plugins are required)

  a) The wmextension plugin

    cd ./src/ex/
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    (sudo) make
    (with Avogadro 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 version)
      sudo cp libwmextension.so /usr/lib/avogadro/1_0/extensions/
    (with a higher Avogadro version to 1.0.1)
      sudo cp libwmextension.so /usr/local/lib/avogadro/1_0/extensions/

  b) The wmtool plugin

    cd ./src/tool/
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    (with Avogadro 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 version)
      sudo cp libwmtool.so /usr/lib/avogadro/1_0/tools/
    (with a higher Avogadro version to 1.0.1)
      sudo cp libwmtool.so /usr/local/lib/avogadro/1_0/tools/
      
For the anaglyph (red/cyan), the wmengine plugin :

  a) Requirements :

  These library are required to compile the wmengine plugin. If you
  have Synaptic (or equivalent), you just need to open it and 
  "search and install package":

    - freeglut3 2.6
        and freeglut3-dev 2.6
    - libglew1.5 1.52
        and libglew1.5-dev 1.52

  b) Compilation :

    cd ./src/en
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    (with Avogadro 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 version)
      sudo cp libwmEngine.so /usr/lib/avogadro/1_0/engines/
    (with a higher Avogadro version to 1.0.1)
      sudo cp libwmEngine.so /usr/local/lib/avogadro/1_0/engines/
